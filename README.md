# IdemADV

IdemADV is a Unity Engine toolkit for making first-person 3D adventure games. Why? Because I wanted to make a first-person 3D adventure game (possibly multiple), and I like developing my own tools.

Note that IdemADV is not designed to be a black box! By all means, feel free to tinker with it and change the code to suit your own project's needs.

IdemADV is still very, very much in its infancy, and it's mostly on GitHub for my own personal version control purposes. I do eventually plan to add more info and documentation here, but for now, just ... clone it to check it out if you want, I guess. Do note that this isn't a full Unity project as is (it's missing some of the required files), so you'll have to basically copy the assets and project settings over an existing project. The Unity version I'm using is 6000.3.8f1, though I don't think I'm doing too much that couldn't be made to work in older versions with some finagling.
